An idea to know more about APKs.
Effective way to do so is to debug it dynamically.

Right now it is possible to log all function return values and function parameters.
This is done using Xposed Framework without the need to change the apk.
Another way: use adb to forward the Application process to a port then attach jdb to the same port. The rest is break points and local variable dump.

Examples will be uploaded... soon I hope >.<
